			 The problem I faced was that Smaller Earth was looking for a game to encourage people to go to their  Summer Camp in Canada.  This game would be a wheel of fortune game in which the user could "Spin the Moose". When the game starts, the moose would spin through 8 different numbers on the wheel and then produce a random prize. Before the user is presented with the prize they were asked to enter details.

				Research was carried out to gather an understanding of what the client wanted from the game, for example, the weighting of the prizes. The other research carried out was desk research to gather inspiration from similar games to be able to design an idea for Smaller Earth.  The last research was to look at Smaller Earth website and collect their themes for their navigation bar.

			Low-fidelity prototypes were used to create quick, rough sketches of different parts of the design, for example, the moose and the background image. High-fidelity prototypes were created in a photo editor and code to produce the final design. A game show theme was chosen because this build is to be a game with the chance to win 8 different prizes. The colours for the spin the moose board was chosen to stand out from the background.

						The game was developed using HTML, SASS/CSS and JavaScript. The game works by clicking a button to make the moose spin which produces a form for the user to enter personal details to claim the prize and once this is done the spinner re-appears with the prize they have won.

				 This build was tested using manual testing and user testing. Manual testing involved creating different situations to test the game in and writing down the results so any problems can be highlighted. User testing was conducted to allow users to test the game to see how easy it is to play and to gather feedback.
